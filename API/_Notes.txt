-- Necessary parts of the API --
1: Controllers
- The controller contains the touchpoints of the api when a specific endpoint is called
- These actions can be anything from returning text to logging data
- In our project, we also use a base api controller to establish a primary endpoint   
    - Other controllers inherit from this base to add different functionalities at extensions from that endpoint

2: Entities
- Entities are data structures that we can find in our entity framework database
- The rule of thumb I believe exists is that each table in the database contains one kind of entity
- I believe that we should avoid having entities create any data through self-referencing methods
    - They should only contain fields that are in the database

3: Data Context
- This is the most adjacent point of the database to the api program
- It doesn't need much, but should contain properties that represent staged changes to the database
    - For example, the DataContext class in this program has a DbSet of AppUsers that we populate to log data

4: DTOs
- Standing for Data Transfer Objects, these components represent data that is actually sent clientside from the server
- They will usually contain bits and pieces of entities, or the results of actions on entity data
- Controllers will send ActionResults of DTOs
- There can also be DTOs that use different permutations of the same Entity for different purposes
